SerialBluetooth
===============
Android app that opens a serial connection to an external device and can send and receive data from it.

The MAC address of the target device is configurable by the user.

Basic Arduino sketch can be found in folder 'ArduinoSketch'.

Added a Processing sketch that builds a similar Android applicaction with much simpler code (BTSketchProcessing.pde). 
The skecth is based on the original work of Oscar at http://webdelcire.com/wordpress/archives/1045 with very minor modifications (compatibility with latest versions of Android and Processing.
